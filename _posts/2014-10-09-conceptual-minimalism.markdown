Last night, my roommate and I were celebrating Taco Tuesday at a local dive. Whenever he and I spend more than a few minutes together, the conversation is almost guaranteed to be interesting (and often quite colorful).

Between bites of the juicy grilled chicken surrounded by an unassuming flour tortilla, our conversations jumped between business, gadgets, and hair-brained schemes to change the world.

Eventually, our conversation settled on something a bit deeper -- something that I referred to as **conceptual minimalism**.

So what does that mean? I wasn't really sure about that when the words left my mouth, but it has started to make sense to me throughout the day today.

My roommate and I are very different people. He barely owns anything; just what he needs to get by. I, on the other hand, furnished most of our shared abode with things I already owned. But I still somehow consider myself a minimalist. But how? That's where conceptual minimalism comes into play.

I consider conceptual minimalism to be a sort of mental decluttering. When I have a thought, I process it down to the most basic form possible and use that to decide if it is something worthy of my limited time, energy, and thought power. I didn't realize it, but conceptual minimalism is a discipline I have been pursuing for many years now. It has always been an intentional pursuit, but I never thought of it as a form of minimalism.

My roommate has very few possessions, yet he often can't help but become overwhelmed by the clutter of his mind. I have very little mental clutter, while I have no shortage of physical possessions. An interesting dichotomy within minimalism.

I would love to hear your thoughts on this topic. It's a fresh thought for me, so any perspective from others who have similar (or entirely opposite) tendencies is very much welcome.
